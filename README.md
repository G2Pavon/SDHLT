I will try to remove things and features (compiler parameters) that i never used, use or will use. I hope I don't break anything.
- less features - less code = less paintfull code to read

Commands or functions that I only want to keep:

***CSG***: -cliptype -noskyclip -nowadtextures -wadautodetect
***BSP***: -subdivide -maxnodesize
***VIS***: -fast -full
***RAD***: -bounce -chop -coring -extra -blur -gamma -fade -scale -sky -smooth -sparse -texchop -noskyfix
