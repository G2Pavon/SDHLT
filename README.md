The idea is to have a "clean" code to investigate and understand how the compilation tool works since the original zhlt/vhlt is a mess that is very difficult to understand.It is a fork of shdlt because it is easy to build on linux. (btw idk how to program in C++ i'm learning with this project)

In the future I would like to convert the C-style data structures into classes.
