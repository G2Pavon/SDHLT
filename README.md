Is this a replacement for the current map compile tools? No, this project aims to simplify and "clean up" the source code of the HL map compile tools in order to make it easier to understand how the tools work, as the original codebase is complex and hard to understand. 

How? well basically most of arguments were removed (which ones are still left? look [here](https://github.com/G2Pavon/SDHLT/blob/master/src/sMCT/common/arguments.cpp)), replaced macros  `#define` constants with `constexpr`, using `auto`, removed old map file version (<220 and QuArK) support, the main() function was simplified by adding functions to handle arguments, for example [smct qcsg.cpp](https://github.com/G2Pavon/SDHLT/blob/master/src/sMCT/sCSG/qcsg.cpp#L1090-L1162) vs [sdhlt qcsg.cpp](https://github.com/seedee/SDHLT/blob/9b94e4fd1c4392802e1a01256596ea69894afc49/src/sdhlt/sdHLCSG/qcsg.cpp#L1719-L2421) . It's still difficult to read, but at least there are fewer lines of code. I probably got fucked up some function along the way, but it still generates playable bsp maps. (Btw, I'm learning C++ with this project)

is a fork of SHDLT (because is ease build on Linux), which itself is a fork of VHLT cleaned up from twhl, which in turn is a fork of VHLT, which is a fork of ZHLT, and so on.

There is still a lot more "cleaning" to do.
Something I would like to do in the distant future is transition C-style data structures to C++ classes
