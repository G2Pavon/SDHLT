This project is aimed at simplifying and "cleaning up" the source code of the HL map compile tools. The main goal is to create a less feature-heavy version of these tools, as the original ZHLT/VHLT/SDHLT codebase is complex and difficult to understand.(btw with this project, i am also learning C++ btw)

is a fork of SHDLT (chosen for its ease of building on Linux systems), which itself is a fork of VHLT cleaned up from twhl, which in turn is a fork of VHLT, which is a fork of ZHLT, and so on.

Future idea: transition C-style data structures to C++ classes
